# PropertyTransfer Smart Contract using Escrow

A Solidity smart contract to manage property transactions with escrow and refund mechanisms.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add Properties**: Admin (initial deployer) can register properties.
* **Buy Properties**: Buyer pays the exact Ether amount to initiate transfer.
* **Escrow System**: Ether is stored in the contract until seller confirms.
* **Ownership Transfer**: Current owner can finalize and receive payment.
* **Refund Option**: Buyer can cancel the transaction and receive refund before seller confirms.
* **Dynamic Pricing**: Price increases by 0.1 Ether after each successful transfer.

## üí≥ How It Works

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract. The deployer becomes the initial contract admin.
2. **Add Property**: Admin adds a property with ID, name, location, and price.
3. **Buy Property**: Buyer sends Ether equal to the price. Contract stores it.
4. **Seller Confirms**: Property owner calls `transferOwnership()`, Ether is sent, ownership is updated.
5. **Refund**: Buyer can call `refund()` before confirmation to get their Ether back.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Security Notes

* Uses `require()` for validations.
* Refund is protected against **reentrancy** by updating state before transferring funds.
* Only current owner can transfer ownership.
